Newspaper test website

This test website was made for educational purpose as a university project. There's only one page, the homepage, which mimics The Telegraph homepage in terms
of responsiveness and general layout. It has a working modal that opens the All Section menu, working Social Buttons (they just redirect to their own website instead
of the Newspaper's own social profiles) and a working back to top button. Because of the latter, all the empty links in the document act themselves as Back to Top
buttons. 
Being a university assignment, there's no commercial purpose behind this test website
